# First Semester Programming Journey  

This collection of code represents my journey through the first semester of learning programming. Over the past few months, I’ve tackled a variety of exercises that have deepened my understanding of programming fundamentals while enhancing my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills. Each file included in this collection serves as a stepping stone in my development as a programmer, reflecting both my progress and the effort I’ve put into learning.  

## Overview of Exercises  

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort to efficiently organize data.  
- **Number Manipulation**: Solved tasks like identifying prime numbers, calculating factorials, and generating Fibonacci sequences.  
- **File Processing**: Gained experience in reading and writing external data to files.  
- **Date and Time Utilities**: Built without using the `ctime` library to deepen manual problem-solving skills.  
- **String Manipulation**: Worked on reversing strings and checking for palindromes, showcasing character-based operations.  
- **Input/Output Programs**: Developed foundational skills in user interaction and input handling.  
- **Arrays and Matrices**: Performed operations such as matrix addition and transposition.  
- **Games and Simulations**: Combined creativity and logic to create interactive projects.  

## Approach and Constraints  

Throughout this semester, I’ve adhered to specific personal constraints to enhance my learning experience:  
- Avoided libraries like `sstream` and `ctime` to focus on manual problem-solving and mastering core logic.  
- Simplified structures where possible to better understand fundamental concepts.  

## Conclusion  

This collection highlights my technical achievements and dedication to programming fundamentals. It reflects my perseverance and curiosity, serving as both a record of my progress and a strong foundation for further growth in the field of programming.
